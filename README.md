# Kernel Community

Kernel is an ongoing invitation into conversation with your peers.

Kernel is about building, through repeated interactions with peers, the patterns required for a better web.

Kernel is a gathering of fellows — technologists, artists, engineers, researchers, designers, linguists — who are building or researching something novel.

Kernel is a peer-to-peer learning environment dedicated to the journey towards a better understanding of truth: in our work, in our relationships with others, and in our inner worlds.

We aim to change the way we think of contributing and the kinds of projects to which we contribute. Kernel is about humility, honesty, gratitude, and intentional service.

1. We are humble because, through our curiosity, our creativity, our suffering, our joy we have come to know and embody how little any one person can know in isolation.
2. We are honest because it is the most courageous way to live, the straightest path from head to heart, and the means of connecting them permanently.
3. We are grateful because there is no other choice. Any examined life can only ever lead, in the final analysis, to gratitude beyond reason or measure.
4. Our intention is to serve, because it brings us back - again and again - to humility.
5. We are patient, because planting a seed is not enough: the kernel will only sacrifice itself and become a forest in the right season.
