I've been asking, "What is money?" for more than ten years. Part of that journey has been about giving up the desire for one, definitive answer.

Today, though, another step in the journey has become clear in a way that is quite unique for me. It's not an answer, but an invitation.

**Money is permission.**

<HonourGate>

## Some Context

Sometimes, the traditional conceptual properties suffice: money is a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. When programming money, [considering the tensions between each property](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/properties-of-money/) can be more insightful: legitimacy, solvency, and liquidity. In other contexts, specific features like portability, durability, divisibility, fungibility etc. are more descriptive. 

I have learnt a lot by thinking about [money as a promise](https://markburgess.org/promises.html), both in the social sense and in that implied by asynchronous programming languages. Money as a promise is intellectually satisfying, but it doesn't satisfy all the feelings I have about it. Paying, receiving, or being unable/prevented from doing so doesn’t always feel like a promise, at least to me.

I hosted a conversation in Ghana where we asked each other, "What is money?" and focused on what it felt like to have or not have "it" so as to understand the question more. For some, to have it engendered feelings of optionality, freedom, agency, but it also meant responsibility, anxiety (lest they lose it), heaviness, privilege. Not having it meant feelings of constriction, frustration, limitation, but also freedom, a call to resourcefulness and creativity, resilience. 

What is it that can call up such a range of human responses through both its presence and absence?

Which brings me back to my inviting metaphor: "money is permission".

## Pass It On

The first level of this metaphor is straightforward. It helps me understand the positive feelings of those who have money, and the negative ones of those who don't. If you have money, you may do stuff. If you don't, you may not.

With money, you may eat here, or board this flight, or ride in that Uber, or sleep in this bed. If you don't, you may not. You do not have permission. It may not be the only kind of permission you need, but it is the foundational one.

As a friend who comes from very little, and has now "succeeded" in his professional life says, "If you have a problem that can be solved by money, it's not a problem."

This more accurately covers the feelings I have, both when I have money and when I don’t. Not being able to pay, or not having something which is perceived as acceptable money, does not feel like a broken promise: it feels like being denied permission.

The second level of the metaphor is a play with the notion of “permissionless”, which is so often quoted when talking about programmable money on blockchains. We’ve made something which **is** permission, permissionless. Noticing this is the most direct route into the heart of what feels radical (and contradictory) about magic internet money. That is, we’ve made it possible to participate in, and create your own, monies which do not depend on specific authorities.

The whole situation is very [weird](https://read.kernel.community/en/tokens/token-studies/honour).

## Weird Wisdom

Trying to untangle what it means to make that which **is** permission, permissionless leads to the third level of the metaphor, which revolves around how “permission” is meant in what we now call "wisdom traditions" like Sufism or Zen. 

I specifically choose these two because they reveal contradictory aspects of permission, which helps throw light on the overall, highly contradictory situation that claiming “money is permission” puts me in.

In Sufism, the esoteric heart of Islam, everything revolves around permission, because every surah in the Qur’an begins with “Bismillah” or “By Your permission”. It is said that the whole wor(l)d is encapsulated in the dot beneath the B in Arabic script. The concept of permission is baked in from the very start. In Sufi practice, this is extended by the notion of [*idhn*](https://www.almirajsuficentre.org.au/qamus/app/single/557)*.* One must receive permission before one can pass on what one has learnt.

In Zen, although there is Kechimyaku and dharma transmission, the day-to-day practice is about presence as permission, or self-permission. You need to give yourself permission to be present with what is, to just sit, to be happy.

In the lived practice of Sufism, it becomes apparent that the only real permission comes from Allah, and Allah is closer than your jugular vein, right here in your heart of hearts. So permission comes from the same source Zen points directly at, it is just arrived at in a manner more suited to the cultural context in which Sufism took root.

The key point in both traditions is that the permission you sought from external authorities must finally be found within. It must become permissionless. Your expectation that someone or something or some God out there will save you must be broken, just as your assumption that you can save anyone else must also break. Permissionless permission is quite the state, because it claims what cannot ever be claimed, without being discourteous, or inflating the ego.

## The Buck Stops Here

What does all this have to do with money, though? Is the advent of permissionless money indicative of the slowly-dawning, collective realisation that we do not need to outsource the ability to decide on value and agree on a fair price to anyone else? 

Are we wise enough to give ourselves permission and live through the inevitable social changes that must arise when there are less monolithic, unquestionable sources of power; and many more small, contextual, consensually-arrived-at powers?

Individually, it is not easy to give yourself permission, because it is simultaneous with accepting responsibility. It’s one reason why having money makes some people feel anxious: they now have the responsibility to do something with it, and not lose it.

Of course, you can also reject the responsibility, and use the opportunity to manipulate others and benefit yourself. A lot of that happens today. But it is a short term game, and everyone knows it. If you’re winning or losing, then you’re still playing a permissioned game (because winning and losing require rules and a judge). Permissionless, infinite games are ones where we play with the rules themselves as a means of ensuring that the game goes on.

## The Work

Even if you do accept the responsibility, collective realisations are generational work. So, if we sincerely want to make what is permission permissionless, how do we practically “do the work”?

The best suggestion I have seen so far is to [formalise what it means to accept a currency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXG9tbsRPlQ). This is interesting because, done well, we can create systems in which another’s willingness to accept a currency that I won’t touch can still help us all, collectively, settle more debt. 

Someone else being willing to deal in USDT, even though I won’t, means we can all do more with less money. The number of actions we can take increases; the amount of permission we need decreases. This is deeply profound. This is a shift in power I want to participate in.

Bitcoin proved that we could all agree on a tiny, seemingly insignificant bit of information, updated block by block. The fact that everyone in the world, irrespective of language, culture, beliefs or background, continues to agree on the state of the network has already played a role in major changes socially, politically, financially and otherwise. 

Proof of work inspired me to try and prove some other stuff, like [love](https://thebluebook.co.za/). It led me to begin mapping what it might mean [to learn when traditional authorities had lost their archetypal power](https://www.thebookofguidance.com/docs/introduction). 

Formalising what you accept (which necessitates understanding *why* you accept it) is the same thing as giving yourself permission. In order to do either, you must see things as they are, not in terms of what others want you to believe about them.

Critically, when I “see something as it is”, it doesn’t mean I perceive some objective Truth. I perceive my truth, am thoroughly grounded in it, and can **therefore** entertain the possibility that it might appear differently to another. That what or how I value might not be how another does. Our goal when relating well should not be to force a reductive collapse of different viewpoints, but to create systems that enable us to find helpful, mutual terms *without arbitrary permission*.

I don’t think we get to a world without money, because permission is baked into some of the deepest insights we have in the human record. But I do think a worthy goal is to reduce as far as possible the amount of permission required to take any given action in the world. 

I think a world with less permission and more people acting on what they truly perceive is an inherently more beautiful world. And I think we get there when each and every human being considers deeply what we are each willing to accept, which is the same as saying what responsibility we are each willing to shoulder.
