# Citta

The terms "citta" and "dhamma", which form the last two pillars are a little more difficult to translate than body, breath, or feeling. "Citta" means something more like heart-mind: it is certainly not just an intellectual sense, but one that is - as always - embodied, incarnate, spirited.

We invite you to listen to [Mindfulness of Mind with Joseph Goldtein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ0YeBIOaFw) for another, more detaile dperspective of some of the ground covered above.
